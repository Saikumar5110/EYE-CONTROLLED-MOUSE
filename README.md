# EYE-CONTROLLED-MOUSE
The Eye Controlled Mouse is an AI-based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project designed to control the computer mouse using only eye movements and blinks. It uses computer vision and facial landmark detection to track eye gaze and convert it into mouse actions such as cursor movement, left-click, and right-click.
