👁️ Eye-Controlled Mouse

The Eye-Controlled Mouse is an AI-based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project designed to control the computer mouse using eye movements and blinks. It uses Computer Vision and Facial Landmark Detection to track eye gaze direction and converts it into mouse actions such as cursor movement, left-click, and right-click. This project enables hands-free computing and assistive technology for users with physical disabilities.

🚀 Features

✔️ Real-time eye gaze tracking
✔️ Cursor movement using eye direction
✔️ Blink detection for left & right click
✔️ Hands-free computer control
✔️ Lightweight & works with basic webcam
✔️ AI-based assistive technology for disabled users
